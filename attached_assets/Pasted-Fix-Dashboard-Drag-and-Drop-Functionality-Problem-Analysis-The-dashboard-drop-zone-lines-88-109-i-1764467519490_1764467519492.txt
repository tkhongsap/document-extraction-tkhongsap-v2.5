Fix Dashboard Drag and Drop Functionality
Problem Analysis
The dashboard drop zone (lines 88-109 in client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx) has three issues preventing drag-and-drop:

Wrapped in Link component: The motion.div is wrapped in <Link href="/extraction/general">, making the entire area a navigation link that interferes with drop events
No drag-and-drop handlers: Missing onDragOver, onDragLeave, and onDrop handlers
No preventDefault(): Browser default behavior (opening PDFs) isn't prevented
Solution Approach
Use react-dropzone (already installed) consistent with the extraction page pattern, and implement file transfer via sessionStorage for seamless navigation.

Implementation Steps
1. Update Dashboard Component (client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx)
Import useDropzone from react-dropzone and useLocation from wouter
Remove the <Link> wrapper around the drop zone
Add useDropzone hook with:
onDrop handler that stores file in sessionStorage and navigates to /extraction/general
Same file accept patterns as extraction page
maxFiles: 1
Apply getRootProps() and getInputProps() to the motion.div
Add isDragActive visual feedback (border/background changes)
Keep a separate clickable button/link for manual navigation (outside drop zone)
2. Update Extraction Page (client/src/pages/extraction.tsx)
Add useEffect hook to check sessionStorage on mount
If file data exists in sessionStorage, restore the File object and set it in state
Clear sessionStorage after loading the file
Handle File object reconstruction from stored data (name, size, type, content)
3. File Storage Strategy
Store file metadata in sessionStorage:

File name, size, type
File content as base64 or ArrayBuffer
Timestamp for cleanup
Note: sessionStorage has size limits (~5-10MB). For larger files, consider:

Alternative: Navigate immediately and let user drop again on extraction page
Or: Upload file first via API, then navigate with file ID
Files to Modify
client/src/pages/dashboard.tsx - Add dropzone functionality, remove Link wrapper
client/src/pages/extraction.tsx - Add sessionStorage file restoration logic
Considerations
Maintain visual consistency with existing drop zone styling
Ensure drag state visual feedback matches extraction page
Handle edge cases: file too large for sessionStorage, invalid file types
Preserve existing click-to-navigate functionality with a separate button
