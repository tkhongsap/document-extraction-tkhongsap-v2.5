## Overview

LlamaExtract is a service designed for extracting structured data from unstructured documents like PDFs, text files, and images. The platform is accessible through three interfaces: a web UI, Python SDK, and REST API.

## Ideal Use Cases

According to the documentation, LlamaExtract serves well when you need:

- **Typed output for subsequent processing**: "You want to extract data from documents and use it for downstream tasks like training a model, building a dashboard, entering into a database, etc."

- **High-accuracy extraction**: The service leverages advanced language models to ensure quality results.

- **Schema iteration support**: Users can rapidly refine schemas and validate them against sample documents.

- **Multi-format support**: The platform handles PDFs, text files, images, and additional formats upon request.

## Getting Started Steps

1. **Web UI**: The simplest entry point is the web UI, where users define extraction parameters and process documents via drag-and-drop interface.

2. **API Key**: Developers should obtain an API key to access programmatic capabilities.

3. **Python Library**: The recommended approach for production-scale extraction jobs uses the Python SDK.

4. **REST API**: Alternative integration method for non-Python environments.
